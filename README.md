2. 'react-todo' is a simple application of manageing 'todos'. Thus allowing you to,
    * Add a todo to todos list.
    * remove a todo from the todos list.
    * mark a todo as completed.
    * fetch a particular 'todo' details based on 'id' parameter.
3. 'react-redux' is a simple react-app which lets you use redux in it. This app is for absolute beginners to learn the usage of redux in a react-app.
4. 'redux-todo' is a simple 'react-redux' application which,
    * combines what we learnt in 'react-todo' app and 'react-redux' app.
    * explores the world of redux by building 'todo' application.
    * apart from the functionality of a normal 'to-do' app, this project will also allow you to access 'previous' and 'next' state of an    event.
